"""
Function-calling tools exposed to the LLM (Pipecat 1.8.1 API).

Pipecat auto-generates each tool's schema from its name, type hints, and docstring — list
these on the LLMContext: LLMContext(tools=INNOVENTIX_TOOLS).

Scheduling backend: Cal.com (cal_com.py) — replaces Calendly (calendly.py is now parked,
same as the earlier Google Sheets/Calendar attempt before it, and email_sender.py). Easy to
revert to either later without rebuilding from scratch, since all three keep the same
get_open_slots/book_slot/format_display interface.

No N8N anywhere — every tool talks to its backend directly via aiohttp.

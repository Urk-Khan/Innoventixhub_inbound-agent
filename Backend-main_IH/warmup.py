"""
Pre-warming, run once when the server boots — not per call.

What "10 seconds before the bot responds" is actually made of, and what each piece here does
about it:

1. Silero VAD model load: every call constructs a fresh SileroVADAnalyzer (it holds
   per-call state, like a conversation's running silence/speech counters, so it can't be
   shared live across simultaneous calls). But loading the ONNX model file from disk and
   spinning up an onnxruntime.InferenceSession is the same work every time, and the first
   one after a cold boot is slow (disk read, session init). preload_vad_model() does that
   once at startup so the OS file cache is warm and onnxruntime's first-run cost is already
   paid before any caller dials in.

2. Cartesia STT/TTS connection: Pipecat already sets up all of a call's processors
   *concurrently* (confirmed by reading pipecat's own source — this isn't sequential), so
   the real bottleneck is the slower of the two Cartesia WebSocket handshakes (DNS + TCP +
   TLS + auth to api.cartesia.ai), not their sum. warmup_cartesia() opens a throwaway
   connection to Cartesia once at startup and closes it immediately. This can't make the
   *next* call's connection reuse this one (each call needs its own authenticated session —
   see PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md for why a live connection pool isn't safe to do here), but it
   does warm the DNS resolution and TLS/TCP path to Cartesia's servers, which measurably
   helps on Windows machines in particular (this project already needed an IPv4-forcing
   patch for exactly this kind of handshake slowness).

Both run once, concurrently, at server boot — see the end of bot.py's __main__ block.
Neither one blocks startup if it fails; a warmup failure just means the first real call pays
the full cold-start cost, same as before this existed.

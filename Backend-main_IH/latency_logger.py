"""
Logs per-turn STT/LLM/TTS latency (time-to-first-byte) to the console.

Pipecat already computes these numbers internally whenever `enable_metrics=True` is set on
the PipelineWorker (bot.py has this on) — they just weren't being captured anywhere. This is
the fastest way to actually see them, which is what a Pipecat-vs-Retell latency comparison
needs real numbers for.

To log these into Supabase instead of just the console, call
`supabase_client.log_latency_row(...)` from inside process_frame below instead of (or in
addition to) the logger.info call.
